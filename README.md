# Dynamic General Equilibrium Model with AI Accumulation 

## Introduction
Hi! This is a very basic model to study the **impact of AI on the economy**, which can be parametred as a complement, substitute or something between to workers. For the moment, it only computes the steady state and not the dynamics.

The model was presented for my major thesis at college, which originally was programmed in GNU Octave. My main goal was to show my computational and modelling skills, focusing overall in the macroeconomics field. In this repository, I uploaded the thesis document (in Spanish) for those who want to understand the model, although, as I stated before, there is not a huge complexity in this model, at least for those experimented with DGE models. 

In general, it is more a toy model than a usable model in the life of an economist, yet I find there is some value as it can be used to learn how to code this kind of models or to extent it to make it more powerful (below some possible extensions). However, being simple means that it is also simple to compute, meaning that almost any computer in the world should be able to run this model, even if it is extended as I was talking previously. 

## How to use it 

First, of course, import the repository to be able to run it. After that, you may want to change the parameters to see how the solution changes and make a static comparative exercise. To see what each parameter comes from, I highly recommend to read the document where it is included a full explanation of the model and the results obtained. Even those who don't speak Spanish may understand the equations behind it as they are pretty common in formulas from the economic literature.

## Extension suggestions 

Now, here is a list of possible extensions to add to the program or the model in the future: 

- Dynamics of this model
- Fiscal/Monetary policies
- Growth
- Calibration migration from MatLab to Python.
